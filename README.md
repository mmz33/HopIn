HopIn
-----
*So that we can all HopIn with others, and save time, resources and money.*

HopIn is a realtime android application that allows people to share car rides in order to pair up passengers who do not have a way to get to a certain destination, or who do not want to drive in order to save fuel or in order to protect the environment, and drivers who are willing to share a journey to the same or a close-by destination. This would have the added benefits of reducing travel costs (like fuel costs and taxi rides), reducing traffic jams, and reducing pollution due to the decrease in carbon emissions. Moreover, if everyone going to the same destination shared a vehicle, there would be more parking spaces available.
Parking space unavailability, pollution, and traffic jams are problems that people living in Lebanon face everyday. HopIn could be the long-awaited solution to these problems. Moreover, carpooling could also affect the economy positively if fuel prices go up.

Note: The app consumes the battery rapidly due to the network providers I am using so it needs power optimization tricks which will be implemented later :)
