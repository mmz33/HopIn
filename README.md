HopIn

*So that we can all HopIn with others, and save time, resources and money.*

HopIn is a realtime android application that allows people to share car rides in order to pair up passengers who do not have a way to get to a certain destination, or who do not want to drive in order to save fuel.

Note: The app consumes the battery rapidly due to the network providers I am using so it needs power optimization tricks which will be implemented later :)
